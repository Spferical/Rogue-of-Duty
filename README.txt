ABOUT:
I wanted to expand on what I created last year, with you as a small participant
in a battle between two factions. You must lead your faction through battle and
conquer 300 tiles of constantly-spawning enemies.

The tactical feel I wanted was preserved, and there are multiple enemy types.
Gameplay is unique, I think, and rather interesting, though more bland than
what I wanted.
Unfortunately, there is no progression or alternate weapons you can have.

THE ITEMS:
The rifle - a basic ranged weapon. You can fire it in any of 7 directions.
    It deals 5 damage, moving 3 tiles per turn.
The medkit - restores you to maximum HP.
The grenade - you can throw it up to 7 tiles away. It explodes after 3 turns,
    dealing 10 damage in a 4-tile radius.

THE ENEMIES:
    The soldier - moves and shoots. Drops ammo.
    The medic - moves, shoots, and heals teammates when they're near.
        Drops medkits.

Have fun!
