Game like FtF but with progression
	guns shoot as in FtF
	weapons you find
		pistol - 6 bullets to a clip
		regular rifle - reloaded after each fire
		shotgun - shoots out bullets like \|/
			range of 3
			3 bullets
			instakill
		smg - shoots 3 bullets at a time towards one spot
			each bullet is weaker than a rifle's
			like a pistol except more bullets at a time and bigger clip
		grenade - explodes in a 3x3 area
			limited amount, do not replace gun
			moves like a bullet until it reaches target
			explodes 10 turns after thrown
	soldiers
		only shoot the closest enemy

	you are part of one side
	your team is vastly outnumbered
	you can't command your teammates

	top - red
	bottom - blue
	you are a blue

	soldier types
		all have guns
		I: infantry - have just guns
		M: medics - heal injured teammates for 20% health a turn
					if they're closer than the nearest enemy
			drop medkits
		G: grenadiers - have grenades - two per soldier
			also drop grenades if any are left
		?S: shotgunners - have shotguns?
		C: Commando - buffed-up infantry
			better ai? dodge bullets

	sorta like WWI Medic but more chaotic (people don't stay in trenches)
	screen should be taller than 20 tiles...

	grenades MUST be visible when under bullets (or teammates)
		solution - like DF, have the things under a tile flash

Game like the above idea but with missions
	you get a squad and need to take/defend/do something with some location
	e.g. capture this cottage
	random mission, location, friendly squad, enemy squad
	so like mini roguelike battlefront

	you can't rely on your team, so this will be even more like COD than
	the above idea, ha

Modern Cave Warfare roguelike
	you must fight through a few hundred tiles of cave
	soldiers from your faction spawn on the left
	soldiers from the enemy faction spawn offscreen to the right and head towards you
	like battlefront, sorta
	doesn't even need to be in a cave
	this sounds really good so I might use this anyways for RoD
