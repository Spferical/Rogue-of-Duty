Separate objects into layers
	just different lists of objects should do
	e.g.
		map.mobs
		map.items
		map.bullets
		map.grenades? or should grenades go in the items layer?
gameplay modes
	roguelike - you explore a cave
	basically what the current game is, but the map is more of a cave
		just add walls to and erode the edges
		make enemies only spawn out of sight
'chunked' map generation
	when the map is only 20 tiles wide, generate another 5 tiles
	within these 5 tiles can be fancy structures, ruined houses, bunkers, etc
		structures can have loot
